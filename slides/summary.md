## Summary

1. **Constrained decoding guarantees valid structured output**
2. **All major providers support it** (with varying schema features)
3. **It's just a mask** — no finetuning
4. **Modern implementations are fast** — no startup delay
5. **Combine with reasoning** — constraints apply to final output only
6. **Order your schema fields thoughtfully** — Ordering is usually in the constraints
7. **Beyond JSON** — CFG support for SQL, DSLs, and custom formats
